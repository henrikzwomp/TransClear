- About code ----------------------------------------------------------------
I'll assume you have read the readme.txt for the installer, so I won't 
repeat anything already mentioned in that file.

The code is written in C# with "Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for 
Windows Desktop". 

The solution is divided into four projects.

* DevTools
A Console application with a few features and classes that helped me 
troubleshoot various early issues. I have chosen to include them, because 
they might be of use to someone.

* Installer
A WPF project. WPF and MVVM is something that is new to me, so the code 
might be far from perfect.

* LxfHandler
Project with the code that is loaded into the shell.

Many comments found in the code is from SharpShell code that I have copied 
and modified.

* UnitTests
Class project with all the tests.

It uses Nunit and RhinoMocks which I have chosen to not include, so you'll 
need to download them separately to run all the tests.
